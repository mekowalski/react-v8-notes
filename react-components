COMPONENTS
-The HEART of React is Components
-Official React Docs states: Components let you splut the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think
 about each piece in isolation
-Components give both Function and Presentation in modular forms
-Predictable packages to keep organization of code that describe what should be rendered on to DOM

REACT APPLICATION EXAMPLE
-A Song application that displays attributes of the song
1. Write the components
class Song extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        Song Title Uno - Artist Uno
      </div>
    )
  }
}

-Class: New class Song is declared
-React.Component: Song class extends React's Component class which provides built in methods/attributes
-render(): A method defining what should be explicitly returned

2. Use the components
