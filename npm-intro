INTRODUCTION
-Helps organize packages of reusable code for relation to coding work/projects
-Existing code is valuable to suit needs and to incorporate into projects
-Never want to 'reinvent the wheel' and write code that may already exist

SETUP NODE PACKAGE MANAGER
-NPM automatically installed with Node.js, should already be installed in system working with JavaScript
-Command 'node -v' will show the version of Node.js installed (eg: 110119 - v11.2.0)
-Command 'npm -v' will shoe version of NPM itself (eg: 110119 - 6.10.2)

NODE PACKAGE MANAGER(NPM)
-NPM is a package manager for JavaScript, working with JavaScript project directories via command line
-Packages range in size of quite small to massive libraries and frameworks(React/Express)
  -Often times larger packages(React/Express) are built using a combo of other packages
-Modualar design allows ability to build a package using other packages to expand JavaScript world

PACKAGE.JSON
-Holds a list of dependencies within one file of package.json
-This file explains what packages are necessary for specific JavaScript applications
