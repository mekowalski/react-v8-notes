INTRODUCTION
-Helps organize packages of reusable code for relation to coding work/projects
-Existing code is valuable to suit needs and to incorporate into projects
-Never want to 'reinvent the wheel' and write code that may already exist

SETUP NODE PACKAGE MANAGER
-NPM automatically installed with Node.js, should already be installed in system working with JavaScript
-Command 'node -v' will show the version of Node.js installed (eg: 110119 - v11.2.0)
-Command 'npm -v' will shoe version of NPM itself (eg: 110119 - 6.10.2)

NODE PACKAGE MANAGER(NPM)
-NPM is a package manager for JavaScript, working with JavaScript project directories via command line
-Packages range in size of quite small to massive libraries and frameworks(React/Express)
  -Often times larger packages(React/Express) are built using a combo of other packages
-Modular design allows ability to build a package using other packages to expand JavaScript world

PACKAGE.JSON
-Holds a list of dependencies within one file of package.json
-This file explains what packages are necessary for specific JavaScript applications
-Key part in sharing JavaScript code repositories on sites like GitHub
-Instead of including all dependencies with every project, just include a small file to list what NPM needs
-package.json is written in JSON, therefore it will always be wrapped in {} and include key-value pairs
-EG: React/Redux Song App
    {
    "name": "rr-song-client",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "private": true,
    "dependencies": {
      "react": "^16.9.0",
      "react-dom": "^16.9.0",
      "react-redux": "^7.1.1",
      "react-scripts": "3.0.1",
      "redux": "^4.0.4",
      "redux-thunk": "^2.3.0"
    }

NPM INSTALL
-Command 'npm install' within a directory where package.json is present will read each dependency and
 download the packages from npmjs.com where they're hosted
-npm install creates a node_modules folder to hold all downloaded packages
-Those packages have their own package.json with their own dependencies as well
-NPM goes through sub-packages to retrieve any sub-dependencies which is referred as Dependency Trees

NPM INIT
-This will begin a series of prompts, asking about certain content to include in the file
-It will create or edit an existing package.json file


Key Terms
-NPM: Node Package Manager, command line tool for organizing packages of JavaScript code
-Node: JavaScript runtime, allowing JavaScript to run locally on computer instead of browser
