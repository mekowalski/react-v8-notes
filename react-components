COMPONENTS
-The HEART of React is Components
-Official React Docs states: Components let you splut the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think
 about each piece in isolation
-Components give both Function and Presentation in modular forms
-Predictable packages to keep organization of code that describe what should be rendered on to DOM
